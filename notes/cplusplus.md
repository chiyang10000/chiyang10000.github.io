- parentheses/braces
- std::getline(is, s)`
- size() and int comparison
- compensating advantages
- direct/copy initialization
- list initialize if possible
- by routinely using iterators and !=
- default/value initialized
- free-standing library function



- act on
- in c++, the distinction is less simple
- programmer's intervention
- lvalue yields function?



- null statement
- extraneous
- declaration statement?
- while with declare multiple variable
- exception safe



- compile indenpendently
- top-level const are ignored in parameter
- std::tuple list initialization
- EXIT_SUCCESS EXIT_FAILURE
- name lookup/type checking
- redeclare function with new argument
- default argument may be function call or variable
- candidate functions/viable functions
- ranks the argument type conversion
- local objet/automatic object? automatic referred to that inside a function



- may call only const member function
- mimic the behavior 
- technically speaking
- meddle with its implementation
- remains in effect until the end of the class body
- why bother?
- and deepen our coverage of the material
- supplies default argument for all its parameter
- static_cast to call constructor
- static member can have incomplete type
